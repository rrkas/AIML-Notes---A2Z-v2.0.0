\chapter{Boolean Retrieval \cite{ir-1}}\label{Boolean retrieval}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Boolean retrieval model is a model for information retrieval in which we can pose any query which is in the form of a Boolean expression of terms, that is, in which terms are combined with the operators \textbf{AND}, \textbf{OR}, and \textbf{NOT}.

    \item The model views each document as just a set of words.
