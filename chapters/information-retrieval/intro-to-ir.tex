\chapter{Introduction to Information Retrieval (IR)}

\section{What is Information Retrieval?}
Information Retrieval (IR) can be defined as a software program that deals with the organization, storage, retrieval, and evaluation of information from document repositories, particularly textual information. Information Retrieval is the activity of obtaining material that can usually be documented on an unstructured nature i.e. usually text which satisfies an information need from within large collections which is stored on computers. For example, Information Retrieval can be when a user enters a query into the system. \cite{gfg-what-is-ir}



Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers). \cite{ir-1}


\section{Taxonomy of Information Retrieval \cite{researchgate/47397195_A_Taxonomy_of_Information_Retrieval_Models_and_Tools}}

\subsection{vertical taxonomy}

A vertical taxonomy classifies IR models with respect to a set of basic features.
The vertical taxonomy is built by exploding two basic features of any IR model: the \textbf{representation}, that is the model adopted to represent both the documents and the user queries; and the \textbf{reasoning}, which refers to the framework adopted to resolve a representation similarity problem. 

\subsection{horizontal taxonomy}

A horizontal taxonomy classifies IR objects with respect to their tasks, form, and context. 
The horizontal taxonomy is derived from an analysis of the application areas of IR.


\section{Ad hoc retrieval task}\label{ad hoc retrieval task}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item system aims to provide documents from within the collection that are relevant to an arbitrary user information need, communicated to the system by means of a one-off, user-initiated query. 
    
    \item An information need is the topic about which the user desires to know more, and is differentiated from a query, which is what the user conveys to the computer in an attempt to communicate the information need.

    \item A document is relevant if it is one that the user perceives as containing information of value with respect to their personal information need.
\end{enumerate}
