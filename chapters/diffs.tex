    \textbf{Inclusion in the Set} & The supremum of a set may or may not be an element of the set. & The maximum of a set must be an element of the set. \\
    \hline
    
    \textbf{Existence} & Every non-empty set bounded above in a complete ordered set (like the real numbers) has a supremum & A maximum exists only if there is at least one element that is greater than or equal to all other elements in the set\\
    \hline

    \textbf{Relationship} & If the maximum exists for a set S, it is equal to the supremum. In other words, if $max(S)$ exists, then $sup(S) = max(S)$ & If the maximum does not exist, the supremum is still defined as the least upper bound\\
    \hline

    \textbf{Example} & 
    \begin{minipage}{5cm}
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        $S = \{x \in R | x < 2\}$ \\
        $sup(S) = 2$\\
        $max(S)$ doesn’t exist

    \textbf{Definition} & The likelihood function measures how likely it is to observe the given data under different parameter values of a statistical model. It is a function of the model parameters, given the data. & The marginal likelihood, or evidence, is the probability of observing the data under a particular model, integrated over all possible parameter values weighted by their prior distribution. It serves as a measure of how well a model explains the observed data, considering both the likelihood and the prior distribution of the parameters. \\

    \textbf{Usage} & 
    \tableenumerate{
        \item \textbf{Parameter Estimation}: In frequentist statistics, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) involves finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function.
        
        \item \textbf{Model Fitting}: It helps in fitting the model to the observed data by identifying the most probable parameters
    } &
    \tableenumerate{
        \item \textbf{Model Comparison}: In Bayesian model comparison, the marginal likelihood is used to compute the Bayes factor, which compares the relative plausibility of different models.
        
        \item \textbf{Model Selection}: It helps in selecting the model that best explains the observed data while incorporating the prior beliefs about the parameters.

    } &
    \tableenumerate{
        \item It accounts for both the fit of the model to the data (through the likelihood) and the complexity of the model (through the prior).
