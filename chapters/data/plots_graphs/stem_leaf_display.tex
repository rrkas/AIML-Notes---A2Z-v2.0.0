\section{Stem-and-Leaf Displays \cite{ism-2,wiki-Stem-and-leaf_display}}\label{Stem-and-Leaf Displays}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider a numerical data set x1, .., xn for which each xi consists of at least two digits. 
    \item A quick way to obtain an informative visual representation of the data set is to construct a stem-and-leaf display.
    \item A stem-and-leaf display conveys information about the following aspects of the data:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item identification of a typical or representative value
        \item extent of spread about the typical value
        \item presence of any gaps in the data
        \item extent of symmetry in the distribution of values
        \item number and location of peaks
        \item presence of any outlying values
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constructing a Stem-and-Leaf Display}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select one or more leading digits for the stem values. The trailing digits become the leaves
    \item List possible stem values in a vertical column.
    \item Record the leaf for each observation beside the corresponding stem value
    \item Indicate the units for stems and leaves someplace in the display
\end{enumerate}
