    \textbf{Training data} & Labeled data: Input-output pairs are provided for training. & Unlabeled data: Only input data is provided without corresponding output labels. & Trained from examples \& interaction with environment. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Goal} & To learn a mapping from input data to output labels based on examples provided during training. & To find underlying patterns or structures in input data without explicit output labels. & To learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward by interacting with the environment. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Feedback} & Direct feedback (error signal) is given during training based on the comparison between predicted output and actual output labels. & No explicit feedback based on labeled data; learning typically involves finding patterns or representations within the data. & Feedback is in the form of rewards or penalties from the environment. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Examples} & Classification, regression tasks. & Clustering, association, dimensionality reduction. & Game playing, robotics, resource management. \\
