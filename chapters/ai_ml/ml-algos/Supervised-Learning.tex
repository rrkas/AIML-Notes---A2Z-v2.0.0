\section{Supervised Learning}\label{Supervised Learning}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Supervised learning is learning from a training set of labeled examples provided by a knowledgable external supervisor. \cite{drl-1}

    \item Each example is a description of a situation together with a specification - the label - of the correct action the system should take to that situation, which is often to identify a category to which the situation belongs. \cite{drl-1}
    
    \item The object of this kind of learning is for the system to extrapolate, or generalize, its responses so that it acts correctly in situations not present in the training set. \cite{drl-1}
