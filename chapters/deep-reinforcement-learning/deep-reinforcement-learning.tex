        “\textbf{Reinforcement learning}” to refer to decision-making with uncertain models, and in addition, current actions alter the future behavior of the system. Therefore, if the same action is taken at a future time, the consequences might not be the same. This additional feature distinguishes RL from “mere” decision-making under uncertainty.\cite{arxiv-2304.00803}
